                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is a python project launcher.
                        It uses a combination of file handling methods to create and write python file, when requested.
                        Because I am opposed to documentation, there is little to no documentation, aside from at the start.
                        Each file is stored in a docstring, and is written with the create() function.
                        This file can and will work locally, no matter what filepath it is in. This is because of the ntpath, sys, and os python modules.
                    </p>
                    Currently there are two projects stored:
                    <h2>Command Line Interface</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is the only completed project as of 2/15/2026.
                        It was made to model a cisco switch from the networking simulation software 'Packet Tracer'.
                        Despite the name, it is not a traditional command line interface.
                        Instead of gaining input from a command prompt, it uses the output terminal to gather information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How do you create this project?
                        When you run the project (init.py), you will be prompted for input.
                        Enter the words 'Command Line Interface'.
                        <br/>
                        Project size: 24KB
                    </p>
                    <h2>Text Based Game</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project is currently unfinished.
                        This IS a game, and is based off of text-input games from the prehistoric ages.
                        Because it is unfinished, I do not recomend launching this project.
                        This game will be eventually integrated into ?avns.tutel.dev as I learn javascript.
                        In the game, you are a soldier who will eventually fight an army of opposing soldiers.
                        As of 2/15/2026, the project (init.py) only has the file for main.py, and not any of the required modules or text files.
                    </p>
