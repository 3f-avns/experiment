    	<h3>LAN</h3>
    	<p>
      		LAN or Local Area Network is a type of network that consists of a small amount of receiving devices, or hosts. Hosts are also sometimes called end devices. A LAN can range in size from small (2 hosts) to large (hundreds of hosts)
    	</p>
    	<h3>SOHO</h3>
    	<p>
      		SOHO or Small Office / Home Office is a type of LAN that is specifically for small offices, home businesses, or remote work. All SOHOs are LANs, but not all LANs are SOHOs
    	</p>
    	<h3>SOHO vs LAN</h3>

		Here is an important fact to remember:
		<br/>
		NOT all LANs are SOHOs, but ALL SOHOs are LANs

Business Network
“A business network is a system of interconnected individuals, businesses, or organizations that interact to achieve common goals, share resources, and facilitate the exchange of information. It’s essentially a web of relationships built for professional purposes, often involving the exchange of knowledge, resources, and opportunities.”
Binary
A base-2 number system that is used in computers due to its simplicity. It uses ASCII to transmit and represent characters
Binary is used in all aspects of networking, including hexadecimal
Data Transmission
3 types:
Electrical Signals
Data on electrical pulses through a medium
See Network Media
Optical Signals
Data transmitted using light. Created by coding electrical signals into laser flashes
See Network Media
Wireless Signals
Data transmitted using infrared, microwave, or radio waves
See Network Media
Real - World uses for each type
SOHO - electrical signals or wireless signals
Large networks (cross continent) - optical signals
Personal Data Collection Types
3 types
Volunteered data
Information you WILLINGLY provide
I.e filling forms, creating a profile
Observed data
Information collected from actions you make
I.e browsing history, gps location
Inferred Data
Information guessed based on other data
I.e credit scores, targeted ads
2.1.2
Client / Server Roles
Hosts can act as either a client or server or both
Client Role
To act as a client means that you can receive data from a server, which is an application
Whether or not a client can act like a server is determined by the software installed in the system
Server Role
The role of a server is to send data when requested by the client
A server is an application
Whether or not the server can act as a client is determined by the software installed in the system
2.1.3
Peer to Peer (P2P)
In P2P, hosts can act as both client and server
Smaller networks such as SOHO use P2P for file sharing and printer sharing
Larger P2P networks require a switch
See Switch
Advantages
Easy to set up
Less complex
Lower cost (no dedicated server)
Great for SIMPLE tasks (file/printer sharing)
Disadvantages
No centralized network administration
Less secure
Not scalable
Performance slows when a host acts as both client and server
2.2.2
Network Infrastructure
Network infrastructure is the platform that supports the network
It provides a stable, reliable channel for communications
Can be as simple as a single cable, or as complex as hundreds of thousands of cables of varying types over a global network
End Devices (Hosts)
End devices are devices such as desktops, laptops, printers, VoIP, Wireless tablets/phones, and TelePresence Endpoint
The end devices listed in cisco packet tracer are:
PC, Laptop, Server, Meraki-Server, NetworkController, Printer-PT, IP phone, VoIP device, phone, TV, Tablet, Smartphone, Generic Wireless/Wired End Device, Packet Sniffer, and more that we do not use in cisco 1
VISIBLE components
Also known as the ‘gateway’ between users and a network
Intermediary Devices
Intermediary devices are responsible for forwarding the data they receive to the correct destination. Some examples are:
Routers
Switches
Wireless Routers / Switches
Multilayer Switches
Firewall appliances
Routers control barrier between LANs, and switches operate within LANs
Network Media
See Network Media (the section)
Network media is what data is transmitted across. This includes copper cabling, wireless access points, and fiber optic cabling
Sometimes INVISIBLE components (wireless)
Mostly VISIBLE components (cabling)

Connects multiple devices simultaneously
WiFi
Uses both 2.4GHz and 5GHz ranges
Higher power and range than bluetooth
Supports high throughput for internet and network access
Common in homes, schools, businesses
Wired Network Technologies
Even with wireless growth, wired networks are still important. This is because they are more reliable and have more speed
Ethernet is the most used protocol
Uses various cable types
Category 5e Cabling
Most common LAN wiring (also category 6a, 7, and 8)
4 twisted pairs reduce electromagnetic interference
Uses RJ-45 connectors
Supports fast and gigabit ethernet
Coaxial Cabling
Central conductor with insulating layer and shielding
Used for internet, TV, and some network connects
Mainly used for TV. Remember that, as it will be useful when differentiating between cable types
Durable and resistant to electromagnetic interference

Fiber Optic Cabling
Glass or plastic fibers as thin as human hair
Very high bandwidth, at a long distance
Immune to electromagnetic interference
Uses light, not electrical signals
Wired vs Wireless
Wired:
Stable and fast
More secure
Requires cabling and installation

Wireless:
Mobile and convenient
Easier to install
Subject to interference, and range limits
Wireless Standards(IEEE 802.11)
The IEEE 802.11 standards govern wireless LANs, or WLANs
IEEE 802.11 defines acceptable standards for RF spectrum usage, data rates, and transmission methods
WiFi Alliance
The wifi alliance ensures intercompatibility between devices, by certifying them with the wifi logo
Role of WIFI alliance
The wifi alliance is a non-profit organization that promotes wifi technology and certifies devices for compatibility
This certification ensures intercompatibility among devices from different manufacturers
Wireless Settings
Network Mode
The network mode determines which 802.11 standard is being used
Mixed mode supports multiple standards, and is used for communication with older devices. This may affect speed
SSID
SSID or Service Set Identifier is a network name
It is a case sensitive string of letters and numbers up to 32 characters long
The SSID identifies the WLAN, and the SSID must match on all connecting devices
Broadcasting the SSID allows devices to discover the network automatically; else you have to use manual entry
SSID Broadcast
Enabling SSID broadcast makes the SSID visible to nearby devices
Disabling the SSID broadcast can obscure the path of entry into a network, but it doesn’t secure your network
Strong encryption should always be used
Standard Channel
The Standard channel specifies the frequency channel for communication
Routers can be set to ‘Auto’ to choose the best channel. This reduces interference
Security Recommendations
Only disable the SSID broadcast as an additional measure
Always use the strongest encryption available (examples given are WPA2/WPA3)
Weaker encryption can allow unauthorized access to a network
Importance of ‘Mobile’ Devices
Freedom to work, learn, play, and communicate anywhere that you are, or to move around whilst doing so
No need to be tied to a physical location
Wireless facilities such as internet cafes and campus lounges allow flexibility in working space
Benefits of Using WiFi
If you have a phone, using wifi does not impact your cellular data usage
Most homes have wifi, and most public spaces do also
WiFi is backed with the cloud
WiFi supports encryptions such as WPA2 and WPA3
WiFi enables high-speed connectivity in coverage areas
WiFi Security Precautions
Never send login or passwords using plaintext, always use encryption
Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) when sending sensitive data
Enable security on home networks
Use WPA2 or higher encryption for protection
WPA2
WPA2 stands for WiFi Protected Access 2
It’s a security protocol used to protect wireless networks, by encrypting messages sent over wifi
WPA2 and above replaced the older WEP and WPA standards
You need a key to unencrypt the message, for example, if you are asked for the key and you put in 1, you will get a different message than if you put in 2
WiFi Connection basics
Turn on wifi on the device you are using. This will enable your device to search for available networks using SSID broadcast
Select a network and enter in the password if needed
Configure wireless networks
Manual WiFi Configuration
Required if SSID broadcast is off, or auto-reconnect disabled
Enter the SSID exactly how it is on the router
Select security type, and enter passphrase
Incorrect details will prevent connection. Make sure to check the SSID if you are sure the password is correct
Cellular Data Configuration
Offered by most carriers with varying bandwidth limits and charges
Used when WiFi is unavailable
Transition between networks is seamless (for the user)
Example: moving from 3g to 4g without dropping connection
Bluetooth Pairing
Turn on bluetooth and make device discoverable
Scan for devices and select desired one
Enter PIN or passkey if requested
Pairing info is stored for automatic reconnection
Bluetooth overview
Simple, low power wireless technology
Supports up to 8 devices simultaneously
Used for headsets, keyboards, mice, speakers, tethering, and stereo connections
Automatic pairing after initial setup
VPN; What is it / How do they work
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a secure encrypted connection over the internet
It allows users to connect to a network remotely as if they were physically present, protecting data from hackers and providing privacy
It masks your IP address and encrypts your internet traffic
Think of a VPN like the express lane in some highways. You can only get in a certain points and you are ‘hidden’ from others
You can also think of a VPN like an airport, with your encrypted traffic being an unmarked private plane or something like that
A VPN sends data through a secure ‘tunnel’ to a VPN server
Because the VPN goes through a tunnel to a VPN server and client, VPNs can be slower than non encrypted data
Differences between VPNs and the WakeID Portal
VPN:
Encrypts internet traffic
Masks IP addresses
Used for privacy / security
Works for any network
WakeID Portal
Provides login shortcut to school apps
No traffic encryption
Focused on resource access
Works through web browser
Uses account based filtering
Module 5 (Parts 1 and 2)
Communication Protocols
Protocols are kind of like the language rules of binary. For example, to speak, humans use the same technology, vocal cords. However, if we do not use our vocal cords to make certain sounds when talking, we cannot understand each other. This is where languages come in. Languages use certain sounds paired with one another to form words and thoughts. If one of these sounds is not used correctly, it becomes harder to understand. Communication Protocols are like languages. There are many languages, but they all can convey the same message, but it will sound, or transmit, differently
Protocols govern communication between end devices
Protocols define the method, language, and confirmation of data being received

To do this, you need a defined sender and receiver, a common protocol

Network devices follow similar rules to human communication
Devices must be identified by a MAC or IP address
Devices must use a common protocol such as TCP-IP or Ethernet
Devices synchronize when messages are sent, I.E one after another in a modern WLAN
Devices send ACK packets to acknowledge that they received data
Examples of Protocols
HTTP/HTTPS is used in web communication
SMTP is an email protocol
FTP is the file transfer protocol
TCP is used in the transport layer for reliable delivery
IP - Internet Protocol
Protocol Characteristics
Message Format
Messages must use a common format. They are converted into this format using encoding. The type of format is determined by the channel and medium that the message is being transmitted on
Message Size
The message size is critical. The amount of data transmittable is 46-1500 bytes in each frame/packet
These can be different depending on the protocol
Segmentation
Messages are segmented into smaller parts if a message is too large. This process is called segmentation
Timing
Timing is essential in networking to avoid collisions. Timing is the synchronization and coordination of sending and receiving messages
CSMA/CD
Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection
Used in legacy networks. This only used in half-duplex legacy networks, and CSMA/CA is used in half-duplex technologies today
When each device sends data, it might collide in the medium, and then cause a ‘collision’. CSMA/CD detects these collisions and tells the device to send the data again
CSMA/CA
Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Avoidance
Used in half-duplex wireless networks today
When each device sends data, it doesn't allow any other device to send data until the device is finished sending
Half/Full - Duplex
Whether or not a device can send and receive data at the same time
Legacy ethernet devices could only operate in half-duplex
Nowadays all ethernet devices are full-duplex
All wifi devices are half-duplex (or so we’ve been told)
Encoding
Turning a message into a format that can be transmitted and received correctly
Encapsulation
The process of adding control information to data, to transmit it correctly
For example, in the network layer, the IP header and trailer is added. They are removed from the data in the transport layer, in the deencapsulation process
TCP-IP / OSI Models
Also a section cuz this is important
Each model is a different way of visualizing how data is transmitted
TCP-IP
Does not specify protocols for physical transmission or encoding
Is not used in teaching networking, only practical uses
Four layers;
Application(Application, presentation, session)
Transport
Internet (network)
Network Access (Data Link, Physical)
OSI
More detailed than TCP-IP
Used for protocol development and troubleshooting
Provides a more general framework
Seven layers:
Application
Presentation
Session
Transport
Network
Data Link
Physical
Addressing
This is very important. There are multiple address types, and each serves a specific purpose
MAC (Media Access Control)
This is the physical address of a device. It is used in the MAC data link sublayer
MAC addresses are locally routed, and only used in LANs
The MAC address is encapsulated at each router, when travelling to another LAN
For example, when traveling, you might find yourself wanting to go to point A. to get to point A, you need to cross through multiple towns. These towns are small and don't know the exact directions to get to point A. They point you in the direction they see others going, when going to point A. This happens in each LAN as you travel to your destination. Point A represents the next type of addressing, logical addressing
MAC addresses are written in hexadecimal. The address itself is 48 bits, and each byte is represented by 2 hex characters. My current mac address is 54-E1-AD-2A-41-B1
IP (Logical / Internet Protocol)
IP addressing doesn't tell any device actually how to get the data to a location. That is the MAC address’s job
To route based on a logical address, you need to use either ARP or ND. These will get explained later, but basically, ARP (IPv4) uses what is called an ARP request, which detects if there is a MAC address assigned to the target IP address, on the LAN. if there isn’t, ARP gets the MAC address of the default gateway, or router. This process is repeated until either the TTL runs out, or the IP address is mapped to a MAC address

IP addressing has multiple editions. The original IP addressing scheme was IPv4, but due to never having logical addresses or even the internet before, IPv4 was quickly depleted
IPv4 addresses use a total of 32 bits, or 4 bytes. These bytes are called octets
IPv4 is written in dotted decimal, which groups the decimal value of each octet, and separates them using periods. An example of this is the address 192.168.1.2 this address would be 11000000.10101000.0000001.0000010 in binary, and each octet is shortened into its decimal equivalent
Port Number
Port 80 is what is usually used in the transport layer for what we do in packet tracer. I don’t know why
A port number specifies an application for process to process communication
6.1 Network media
I made a section on this before i started doing notes and stuff, so yeah
Criteria for choosing the media you use:
Maximum distance
Environment
Data amount/speed
Cost
Copper (Metal Wires within cables)
Data encoded into electrical impulses (thats all it tells me in 6.1)
Twisted pair
More info in the section dedicated to media
Common in ethernet networks
Wires grouped in pairs to reduce interference
Widely used in LANs
Coaxial
Early type of network cable
Copper core, with insulation, jacket, and shielding
Used in cable tv and satellite communication
Supports broadband signals
Fiber-Optic (Glass / Plastic Fibers)
Data encoded into pulses of light
Glass or plastic fibers
High speed and long distance
Immune to electromagnetic interference
Wireless
Data encoded via modulation of electromagnetic waves
7.1 Encapsulating and Ethernet Frames
Ethernet is the primary technology used in LANs
Devices connect an ethernet NIC (Network interface card)
Each NIC has a MAC address, which it uses to send and receive data
Frame Fields
Frame fields include:
Preamble/SFD (Start frame delimiter) - a string of 1s and 0s that ends with two 1s, its purpose is to synchronize both NICs
Source / Destination MAC - the MAC address of the sending device, and the receiving device. Switches and other devices use the destination MAC to only read data meant for them
Data - the data, pretty self explanatory
FCS - Frame check sequence, uses a number derived from the data, so that if anything changes, the frame will be discarded and re-sent
Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the process of placing one message format in another
An example is:
Putting the control information (address, routing number) on an envelope
Incorrectly formatted frames are not delivered successfully
De-Encapsulation
Deencapsulation is the process in reverse
This is like opening a letter
Mnemonics
OSI: Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away
Physical to application
TCP-IP: Armadillos Take In New Ants
Application to network access
NIC (Network Interface Card)
Pronounced ‘nick’
A NIC is a component that provides network capabilities for a computer
It may enable a wired, or wireless connection to a LAN
Network Adapter
Many computers nowadays include an integrated networking component called a network adapter
A NIC is a type of network adapter
Hub V. Switch
An ethernet hub is a legacy piece of equipment rarely used today. When it received any data, it would forward the data out of all ports, in the hope that the data would reach the intended destination. This was extremely slow, so we developed the switch
An ethernet switch uses mac addresses to send data to forward the data directly to the destination. Every time you send data through a switch, it will record the source mac address and the port it came in on. Then it will (if it knows the destination port), forward the data out of the port to go to the destination. If it does not know which port to send it out of, it will broadcast the data, like a hub, and then the destination will receive
The Access layer?
I do not remember what this is, so bear with me here

Connects devices to the wired ethernet network
Provides first line of networking devices

I think that this is layer 2, so yeah
Switches operate here, routers operate at layer 3
Switches read MAC addresses to forward frames
MAC address table
Switches input the source MAC address of an incoming frame with the port that the frame came in on
This allows true unicast forwarding
Ensures efficient delivery of frames


Binary / Hexadecimal
Binary is written in a series of 1s and 0s, that represent whether or not there is an electrical current

Ill put some python here eventually to visualize how fast binary is

How Does Binary / Hex Work as a Number System
How Does Binary Work?
Binary is a base 2 system. This means that for every digit, or bit, there are 2 assignable values.
In decimal, a digit can have up to 10 digits, making it a base 10 system
As explained in netacad, each digit has a value according to how many digits follow it. For example, in decimal, 100 has two digits following it, and is 102. You can change the number in this equation, to say, 128, but the overall value is still 10 times greater than 12.8
This works in binary, because in a byte (a section of 8 bits, or digits. A byte is the most common form of binary used in networking, and coding) the 8th bit (see Calculating the value of binary), which is followed by 7 bits, has a value of 27, or 128.

By using this method, or by learning how to quickly add binary, you can find the decimal value of binary.
	Fun Fact: when writing something in binary, you typically use ASCII, and just write the numeral value of the character you wish to write
How Does Hex Work?
Hex works similarly to binary. In fact, every 4 bits can code to a hex value. Following this, with 2 hex characters, the value of the second starts at 16, and goes to 255.
Personally, I find it very confusing to multiply hex by the value of 16 to determine what 5a is, for example. I would instead translate this to the binary form, 01011010, to calculate the value easily.
If you would prefer to just calculate hex straight to decimal, use the same formula to calculate binary to decimal, but use 16 instead of 2
Calculating the value of binary
Binary’s value is calculated in bytes, or series of 8 bits
A bit is a singular 1 or 0
To calculate the the value of a binary number, follow this chart

In a binary byte, you have a total of 256 values, from 00000000 to 11111111

Go to this game to learn binary

A list of all binary values are found in Networking

Binary is also used to calculate hexadecimal
Calculating the value of Hexadecimal
Hexadecimal, or just hex, is built around sets of four bits. Four bits has a value of up to 15, and 16 total possibilities. Hex has a total of 16 values, from 0 to f.

Hex is used in IPv6 addressing as well as MAC addressing
See the list of hex values in Networking
OSI / TCP-IP Models
OSI Model
The OSI model is generally considered to be much more complicated than TCP-IP, but is used in instructional materials
The OSI model consists of 7 layers:
Application Layer
The application layer is where web servers and applications are in this model
The application layer is represented by the ‘Application layer’ in TCP-IP along with the presentation and session layers
The application layer is where data is created, I.E a game application sending data to a host (computer) as the host opens the application
Protocols in use at this layer are:
HTTP
SMTP
FTP
DNS
RIP
Telnet
SNMP
Presentation layer
The presentation layer is not covered by cisco netacad. geeksforgeeks.org says that the presentation layer is responsible for formatting the data into an accepted protocol
It is represented by the ‘application layer’ in TCP-IP along with the application and session layers
Session Layer
The session layer is responsible for establishing a session between a web server and a host
It is represented by the ‘Application layer’ in TCP-IP along with the application and presentation layers
You either do not need to know anything else about this layer, as far as I know
Transport Layer
The transport layer name gives away what it does. Along with the network layer, it transports the data.
Depending on which transport layer protocol you use, you get different results;
If you use the TCP protocol, it is generally slower, but provides error checking
If you use the UDP protocol, it is generally faster, but is prone to errors
Network Layer
This layer is covered more in depth by netacad, so there will be more information. There will be a section about encapsulation of IP protocol in this section, and another section about encapsulation later on
The network layer is the main transport layer, which uses router and layer 3 switches to forward packets based off of layer 3 addressing (network layer is also known as layer 3)
The network layer uses contactless transmitting, meaning that it gets the control information from different layers, rather than its own protocols. The network layer then uses the control information from lower layers to forward a packet
The network layer uses logical addressing
See Topologies

IP Encapsulation
A layer 3 packet is encapsulated using the destination IP address (A.K.A logical Address), source IP address, and the data
More parts will be added on in the data link layer, but the network layer protocols serve as an overall guidance system over ethernet protocols.
If it helps to think of it this way, think of a packet as a train. This train will go to many different stations on the way to its final destination. These stations are routers and switches. The train will eventually arrive at the destination router. The train finds its way to the destination using a map, which has the destination labelled. The train then would navigate to the destination using a map (see ARP/ND)
Data Link Layer
The data link layer is split into two sublayers;
LLC Sublayer
This sublayer is in charge of communicating with upper layer protocols. LLC stands for Logical Link Control
MAC Sublayer
The MAC sublayer uses MAC addresses to forward ethernet frames along a network. An ethernet frame is the final stage of encapsulation from an IP packet. The frame starts with a preamble and start frame delimiter (SFD)
The purpose of the preamble and SFD is to synchronize the receiving network interface card (NIC, see Physical layer)
The MAC sublayer frame also contains the source and destination MAC addresses, in that order.
The ethernet frame is removed when a frame enters a router, then re-encapsulates for the next ‘hop’
See ARP/ND
Physical Layer
The physical layer is where all of the hardware resides. This mainly means hosts, because network devices such as switches or routers operate on higher levels.
A host, or end device, is a pc or laptop that sends and receives data
Network Media
Networks operate using different types of media, or methods to get binary transmissions from one place to another.
Ethernet Copper Cabling
Ethernet copper cabling has multiple different types, and variations
Twisted pair
Twisted pair cables are always copper, and are twisted to reduce electromagnetic interference.
Straight-through cables
Straight through copper cables are used when transmitting from one device to another device of a different type. This type of cabling is used for host to switch, switch to router, and host to router.
This type of cabling uses the same wire termination standards as crossover cables

To Subnet an IPv4 network, you need to know the total number of hosts, and the number of subnets required

For 127 - 255 hosts, use a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, or 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 in binary. /24
For 63 - 126 hosts, use a subnet mask of 255.255.255.128, or 11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000 in binary. /25
For 31 - 62 hosts, use a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192, or 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 in binary. /26
For 15 - 30 hosts, use a subnet mask of 255.255.255.224, or 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000 in binary. / 27
For 7 - 14 hosts, use a subnet mask of 255.255.255.240, or 11111111.11111111.11111111.11110000 in binary. /28
For 3 - 6 hosts, use a subnet mask of 255.255.255.248, or 111111111.11111111.11111111.11111000 in binary. /29
For 2 hosts, use a subnet mask of 255.255.255.252, or 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100 in binary. /30
VLSM
VLSM or Variable Length Subnet Masks is a concept where you can change the subnet mask of a smaller subnet, to hopefully resist IPv4 Depletion

Lets try a problem

In this problem, we have 4 subnets, with the amount of hosts listed below
LAN-A - 101 hosts
LAN-B - 31 hosts
LAN-C - 13 hosts
LAN-D - 3 hosts

For LAN-A, because we have 101 hosts, it has to be a /25 or 255.255.255.128 subnet. For the purposes of this example, lets give this LAN the network address of 192.168.1.0 - 127 /25
For LAN-B, because we have 31 hosts, it has to be a /26 or 255.255.255.192 subnet, because 31 is 1 more than the /27 subnet’s amount of usable host addresses. Lets give this LAN the network address of 192.168.1.128 - 191 /26
For LAN-C, we have to use a /28 subnet. This is because 13 hosts is within the 7-14 host addresses available in this type of subnetwork. For this example, let's give this LAN the network address of 192.168.1.192 - 207 /28
For LAN-D, we have to use a /29 subnet. This is because 3 hosts is too large for the smallest subnet of /30, and not large enough for /28. Let's give this the address of 192.168.1.208 - 215 / 29.
If you plug in these addresses to packet tracer, it should work
255.255.255.0
255.255.255.0 is the default subnet mask for Class C network hosts
See Class C
Prefix Length of /24
255.255.255.0 IPv4 Class C Configuration
To Configure a 255.255.255.0 subnet mask, go into a PC, which for this example is PC.A
For this example, you will need 1 PC

Directions:
	Go to PC.A
	Go to Desktop
	Click on ‘IP configuration’
	Enter in a Class C address in the ‘IP address’ line (see Class C)
	OR
	Enter a non-Class C address in the ‘IP address’ line
	In the ‘Subnet Mask’ line, enter ‘255.255.255.0’
255.255.255.128
255.255.255.128 is not the default subnet mask for Class C addressing, 255.255.255.0 is
This will create 2 subnets, with 126 hosts each;
255.255.255.0 - 127
255.255.255.128 - 255
255.255.255.128 IPv4 Subnet Configuration
To configure a 255.255.255.128 subnet, you first need to decide which subnet the address you are entering in is in. For example; if Switch1 is 192.168.0.124, you cannot configure a PC in the same subnet with the address 192.168.0.130.

Directions:
	Go to PC.A
	Go to desktop
	Click on ‘IP configuration’
	Enter in your IPv4 address in the ‘IP address’ line
	The subnet mask ‘255.255.255.0’ will automatically enter into the ‘Subnet Mask’ line
	Depending on the IPv4 address, change the subnet mask like so:
		192.168.0.1 - 126 = 255.255.255.0
		192.168.0.129 - 254 = 255.255.255.128
255.255.255.192
255.255.255.192 is not the default subnet

How To Survive The POL and Cisco Packet Tracer
Ok, so first things first, you need to check what you HAVE to do. Do not do more than this, or your life will be very hard. When you open up the packet tracer, there should be a ‘check results’ button. Press it to see the required configurations. If you have to configure an IP address, read through the provided document for exactly what IP address to put in. This could be a sentence like ‘for ____ router, use the first available IP address. For switches, use the second’
Find that address. This is the most important step
Then enter in the address

SSH / Telnet Configuration
Copied from ms. jebaraj’s excellently hidden canvas assignment
1. Go to global configuration
enable
configure terminal

2. Set hostname (if not already set)
hostname R1

3. Set the domain name
ip domain-name ncdpi.com

4. Create the local user accounts
(you mentioned both, so I’ll add both users)
username admin secret skills
username ncadmin secret ncpassskills

(You can use password instead of secret if your lab requires it, but secret is better.)
5. Generate the RSA key (1024-bit)
crypto key generate rsa general-keys modulus 1024

When it asks to confirm, press Enter.
6. Force SSH only (no Telnet) on VTY lines & use local login
line vty 0 4
 transport input ssh
 login local
 exit

7. (Recommended) Force SSH version 2
ip ssh version 2
end
write memory ! or  copy running-config startup-config


Now you should be able to SSH to the router’s IP using:
Username: admin (or ncadmin)


Password: skills (or ncpassskills)
 and Telnet will be blocked because transport input ssh only allows SSH.




TELNET
1. Make sure the switch has:
On the switch:
enable
configure terminal
interface vlan 1
 ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0   ← example IP
 no shutdown
exit

line vty 0 4
 password cisco
 login
 transport input telnet
exit

And make sure the PC is in the same network (e.g. 192.168.1.x /24) and can ping the switch.

2. Test Telnet from the PC
On PC-A:
Go to Desktop → Command Prompt


Type:


telnet 192.168.1.2

(Replace 192.168.1.2 with your switch’s IP.)

3. What you should see
If it works:
 You’ll see something like:

 Trying 192.168.1.2 ... Open
User Access Verification
Password:
 After you enter the VTY password, you should get the Switch> prompt.


If it doesn’t work:


“Connection refused” or “timed out” → check:


IP address / subnet


Default gateway (if different network)


line vty config


transport input includes telnet



Commands
	DO NOT ENTER THE COMMANDS STARTING WITH CAPITAL LETTERS
	IT WILL BREAK THE PACKET TRACER
	TO ESCAPE IP DOMAIN LOOKUP, USE CTRL+SHIFT+6
	START IN (config) MODE
ip domain-name abcd.com
username admin secret password
crypto key generate rsa general-keys modulus 1024
ip ssh version 2
line vty 1 3
	transport input ssh
	login local
logging synchronous
	exit
Test connectivity with the command ‘ssh -l [username] [ip address]’ from any PC connected to the router
You can replace ssh with telnet in the command ‘transport input’
I do not know how to do ssh/telnet, we are not doing this today (thankfully)
